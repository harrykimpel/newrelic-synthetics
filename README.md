## Scripts

### kimpel.com.js

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Type | `SCRIPT_BROWSER` |
| Target | <https://www.kimpel.com/> |

## github-insights/

Assets for collecting and visualising GitHub Actions usage metrics in New Relic.

### github-actions-metrics.js

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Type | `SCRIPT_API` |
| Schedule | Once per day |
| Source | GitHub REST API v2022-11-28 |
| Target repo | `harrykimpel/O11yParty-Buzzer` |

Calls the GitHub REST API to collect the previous 25 hours of Actions data (workflows, runs, and jobs) and forwards everything to New Relic as three custom event types.

#### Custom Event Types

**`GitHubActionsWorkflow`** — one event per workflow definition

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `repo` | `owner/repo` |
| `workflowId` | GitHub workflow ID |
| `workflowName` | Display name |
| `state` | `active` / `disabled_manually` / etc. |
| `path` | YAML file path in the repo |
| `url` | Link to the workflow on GitHub |

**`GitHubActionsWorkflowRun`** — one event per workflow run in the lookback window

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `repo` | `owner/repo` |
| `runId` | GitHub run ID |
| `workflowId` / `workflowName` | Parent workflow |
| `status` | `queued` / `in_progress` / `completed` |
| `conclusion` | `success` / `failure` / `cancelled` / `timed_out` / `in_progress` |
| `triggerEvent` | `push` / `pull_request` / `schedule` / etc. |
| `branch` | Head branch |
| `actor` | GitHub username that triggered the run |
| `runNumber` / `runAttempt` | Run number and retry count |
| `durationMs` | Wall-clock duration in milliseconds |
| `createdAt` / `updatedAt` | ISO timestamps |

**`GitHubActionsJob`** — one event per job (up to 30 most recent runs)

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `repo` | `owner/repo` |
| `jobId` / `runId` | GitHub IDs |
| `workflowName` / `jobName` | Display names |
| `status` / `conclusion` | Same values as workflow run |
| `runnerName` / `runnerGroupName` | Runner details |
| `durationMs` | Job duration in milliseconds |
| `startedAt` / `completedAt` | ISO timestamps |

#### Setup

**1. Secure Credentials** — add these in Synthetics > Secure Credentials:

| Credential key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | GitHub personal access token with `repo` (or `public_repo`) scope |
| `NR_INSERT_KEY` | New Relic Ingest — License key |
| `NR_ACCOUNT_ID` | Your New Relic account ID |

**2. Configuration** — edit the top of the script if targeting a different repository:

```js
var GITHUB_OWNER = 'harrykimpel';
var GITHUB_REPO  = 'O11yParty-Buzzer';
```

**3. Create the monitor** in New Relic Synthetics:

- Monitor type: **Scripted API**
- Schedule: **Once per day**
- Paste the full contents of `github-actions-metrics.js`

### github-actions-dashboard.json

A ready-to-import New Relic dashboard with three pages/tabs.

**Page 1 — Overview** (7-day default window)

- Billboards: Total Workflow Runs, Total Job Runs, Total Minutes Used, Success Rate %, Avg Job Duration, Failed Runs
- Area chart: runs over time by conclusion
- Pie: runs by conclusion
- Bar charts: top workflows by run count, jobs by status
- Bar: minutes used per day (30-day trend)
- Table: recent failed / cancelled / timed-out runs

**Page 2 — Workflow Details** (30-day window)

- Bars: run count and avg duration per workflow
- Line: run trend per workflow over time
- Bar: failure rate % per workflow
- Breakdowns by trigger event, actor, and branch
- Full workflow runs table

**Page 3 — Job Details** (30-day window)

- Billboards: Total Jobs, Total Minutes, Avg Duration, Failed Jobs, Unique Job Types, P95 Duration
- Bars: top jobs by count, avg duration by job name
- Area: jobs over time by conclusion
- Pie: jobs by runner group
- Bars: failure rate by workflow, jobs by runner name
- Full jobs table

#### Importing the dashboard

1. Replace every `NR_ACCOUNT_ID` in `github-actions-dashboard.json` with your numeric New Relic account ID
2. In New Relic, go to **Dashboards → Import dashboard**
3. Paste the updated contents of `github-actions-dashboard.json`

#### Sample NRQL queries

```sql
-- Daily run totals for the last 30 days
SELECT count(*) FROM GitHubActionsWorkflowRun
  FACET workflowName TIMESERIES 1 day SINCE 30 days ago

-- Total billable minutes per workflow
SELECT sum(durationMs) / 60000 AS 'Minutes'
  FROM GitHubActionsJob FACET workflowName SINCE 30 days ago

-- Success rate trend
SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE conclusion = 'success') AS 'Success %'
  FROM GitHubActionsWorkflowRun TIMESERIES 1 day SINCE 30 days ago

-- Slowest jobs (P95)
SELECT percentile(durationMs, 95) / 60000 AS 'P95 (min)'
  FROM GitHubActionsJob FACET jobName SINCE 30 days ago LIMIT 20

-- All failures in the last week
SELECT workflowName, branch, actor, conclusion, createdAt
  FROM GitHubActionsWorkflowRun
  WHERE conclusion IN ('failure', 'cancelled', 'timed_out')
  SINCE 7 days ago LIMIT 100
```
